# Brave Dark Theme

Brave's dark theme, ported to Chrome and Chromium-based browsers.

I prefer Brave's default dark theme to Chrome's official dark themes, so I
ported Brave's theme to Chrome. This theme uses the exact same colors as Brave
does out of the box, complete with a dark address bar. I've recreated the new
tab page background with a 1440p gradient that supports displays up to 8K (at
300% scaling, which is realistic). It's the closest you can get without
modifying your browser's source code.
