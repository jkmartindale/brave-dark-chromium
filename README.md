# Old Brave Dark Theme

Brave's old dark theme, ported to Chrome and Chromium-based browsers.

I prefer Brave's old dark theme (before version 1.19) to Brave's current dark
theme and Chrome's official dark themes, so I made a standalone theme file based
on Brave's old dark theme.

This theme uses the exact same colors as Brave did out of the box, complete with
a dark address bar. I've recreated the new tab page background with a 1440p
gradient that supports displays up to 8K (at 300% scaling, which is realistic).
It's the closest you can get to the real thing without modifying your browser's
source code.

Since people keep asking: This isn't an app or extension, this is a theme. It
changes some of the colors of your browser, but it cannot change page colors or
add buttons to your browser.

To remove a theme from Chrome:
1. Go to your browser settings page
2. Scroll down to the Appearance section (you might be able to jump here by
   navigating to chrome://settings/appearance)
3. There should be a row at the top of the Appearance section called Theme,
   listing your current theme
4. Click the "Reset to default" button in that row

The process might be slightly different for other browsers. The theme
uninstallation process is completely controlled by your browser and I cannot do
anything to make it easier.
